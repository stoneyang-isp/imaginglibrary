  abstract = {High quality video sequences are required for the evaluation of tone
	mapping operators and high dynamic range (HDR) displays. We provide
	scenic and documentary scenes with a dynamic range of up to 18 stops.
	The scenes are staged using professional film lighting, make-up and
	set design to enable the evaluation of image and material appearance.
	To address challenges for HDR-displays and temporal tone mapping
	operators, the sequences include highlights entering and leaving
	the image, brightness changing over time, high contrast skin tones,
	specular highlights and bright, saturated colors. HDR-capture is
	carried out using two cameras mounted on a mirror-rig. To achieve
	a cinematic depth of field, digital motion picture cameras with Super-35mm
	size sensors are used. We provide HDR-video sequences to serve as
	a common ground for the evaluation of temporal tone mapping operators
	and HDR-displays. They are available to the scientific community
	for further research.},
