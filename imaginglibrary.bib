Four of the matrices were developed independently for the purpose of transforming tristimulus values to spectrally
sharpened RGB responses. The fifth is the Hunt-Pointer-Estevez transform of CIE tristimulus values to normalized cone responsivities. RGB images were transformed between CIE illuminant D65 and CIE illuminant A white point using each of the matrices and results were examined visually. In addition,

  Abstract                 = {For over 20 years, color appearance models have evolved to the point of international standardization. These models are capable of predicting the appearance of spatially-simple color stimuli under a wide variety viewing conditions and have been applied to images by treating each pixel
as an independent stimulus. It has been more recently recognized that revolutionary advances in color appearance modeling would require more rigorous treatment of spatial (and perhaps temporal) appearance phenomena. In addition, color appearance models are often more complex than warranted
by the available visual data and limitations in the accuracy and precision of practical viewing conditions. Lastly, issues of color difference measurement are typically treated separate from color appearance. Thus, the stage has been set for a new generation of color appearance models. This
paper presents one such model called iCAM, for image color appearance model. The objectives in formulating iCAM were to simultaneously provide traditional color appearance capabilities, spatial vision attributes, and color difference metrics, in a model simple enough for practical applications.
The framework and initial implementation of the model are presented along with examples that illustrate its performance for chromatic adaptation, appearance scales, color difference, crispening, spreading, high-dynamic-range tone mapping, and image quality measurement. It is expected that
the implementation of this model framework will be refined in the coming years as new data become available.},

  Abstract                 = {High quality video sequences are required for the evaluation of tone mapping operators and high dynamic range (HDR) displays. We provide scenic and documentary scenes with a dynamic range of up to 18 stops. The scenes are staged using professional film lighting, make-up and set design to enable the evaluation of image and material appearance. To address challenges for HDR-displays and temporal tone mapping operators, the sequences include highlights entering and leaving the image, brightness changing over time, high contrast skin tones, specular highlights and bright, saturated colors. HDR-capture is carried out using two cameras mounted on a mirror-rig. To achieve a cinematic depth of field, digital motion picture cameras with Super-35mm size sensors are used. We provide HDR-video sequences to serve as a common ground for the evaluation of temporal tone mapping operators and HDR-displays. They are available to the scientific community for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a tone mapping algorithm that is derived from a model of retinal processing. Our approach has two major improvements over existing methods. First, tone mapping is applied directly on the mosaic image captured by the sensor, analogous to the human visual system that applies a nonlinearity to the chromatic responses captured by the cone mosaic. This reduces the number of necessary operations by a factor 3. Second, we introduce a variation of the center/surround class of local tone mapping algorithms, which are known to increase the local contrast of images but tend to create artifacts. Our method gives a good improvement in contrast while avoiding halos and maintaining good global appearance. Like traditional center/surround algorithms, our method uses a weighted average of surrounding pixel values. Instead of being used directly, the weighted average serves as a variable in the Naka-Rushton equation, which models the photoreceptors' nonlinearity. Our algorithm provides pleasing results on various images with different scene content and dynamic range.},
